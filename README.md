### Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn the basics of Python, following tutorials and exercises on DataCamp. The content here includes small projects and scripts that I’ve created to solidify my understanding of fundamental Python concepts.

#### Areas of Learning:
- **Core Python Syntax:** Understanding variables, loops, functions, and data structures.
- **Basic Data Handling:** Simple data manipulation and exploration techniques.
- **Practice Projects:** Small-scale projects and exercises to apply what I’ve learned.

This repository serves as a reflection of my commitment to mastering Python, starting with foundational skills and gradually moving towards more complex topics as I continue my learning journey.
